# About Me

My name is Weikang Meng. My friends call me Waken. 
I’m a backend engineer and co-founder with ten years of experience in system design and large-scale backend development. My work focuses on building high-performance, distributed services that are stable, maintainable, and scalable.  

I’m currently pursuing an MBA in Finance at Indiana State University’s Scott College of Business, where I’m combining my technical background with a deep understanding of business and finance. My goal is to design and lead projects that bridge engineering and strategy — turning data and systems into decisions that create real value.

## Values and Interests

I approach my work with patience and clarity — I believe that strong systems, like strong teams, are built through consistency and understanding. I value honesty, craftsmanship, and learning that lasts longer than the latest framework.  

Outside of work, I enjoy early mornings, table tennis, hiking, and traveling. These activities help me stay balanced, focused, and curious — traits I try to carry into both my work and relationships.
